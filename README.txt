ABOUT ME
--------
My belief is that project management is happening around us at all times, we're 
just not aware of it. For example, planning a vacation, making dinner or fixing 
the house all incorporate elements of project management such as gathering 
requirements, stakeholder management, budget management, etc.

There have been many experiences in my life where I had to use project 
management frameworks to accomplish a goal. I'm confident in my intuitive 
understanding of core project management values and the ability to apply the 
frameworks in a professional setting.
